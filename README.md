# 🐍 Python Y10 Open Day – Student Activities

Two beginner-friendly Python projects designed for a **30-minute taster session**  as part of a Year 10 open day. No prior experience required — just Python, VS Code, and curiosity.

## Activities

| Folder | What you'll build | Time |
|---|---|---|
| [`lesson_personality_chatbot/`](lesson_personality_chatbot/) | A chatbot that responds to keywords with its own personality | ~30 min |
| [`lesson_mini_escape/`](lesson_mini_escape/) | A text-based escape room with rooms, items, and puzzles | ~30 min |

Each activity has its own **README** with a mini primer, step-by-step TODOs, a quick-fix error table, and optional extension challenges.

## Getting started

1. Python and VSCode will already be installed. Just login to the computer and open VSCode.
2. Create a folder called 'code' on the Desktop, if it doesn't already exist. Then open the folder in VSCode (File -> Open Folder).
3. **Clone or download** this repo. ( Open terminal in VSCode then enter:
   `git clone https://github.com/jhudshcg/python_y10openday_student.git` )
4. Open the `.py` file and click **Run ▶**.
5. Follow the comments in the code — they guide you (along with the lesson README.md file) through each change 
(marked by the TODO sections)

> No external packages are needed. Everything runs with the Python standard library.

## Who is this for?

- **Students** attending a college open day who want to try coding for the first time.
- **Teachers / ambassadors** running short programming taster sessions.

## Licence
